# Linear Regression from scratch

Linear regression is just the process of estimating an unknown quantity based on some known ones (this is the regression part) with the condition that the unknown quantity can be obtained from the known ones by using only 2 operations: scalar multiplication and addition.

# Contributions
We love your open source enthusiasm. Seeing a application grow a bigger community is possibly the best thing a developer can expect. but I will update the README once it ends and feel free to make a pull request then.
